# Cloud_Computing_Project
Cloud Computing Project 5
Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features. Docker and Kubernetes are almost synonymous to 'microservices' as they help package and manage the different components of a project/ application, thereby easing up the implementation of a microservices architecture.

In this project, you will work with Docker and Kubernetes to make an easily deployable and portable blogging web-app using Flask and MongoDB.

The microservices architecture will deploy a Kubernetes cluster with a mongodb server pod fronted with a web admin interface and a pod to run the flask app.
